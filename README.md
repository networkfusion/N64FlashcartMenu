# N64FlashcartMenu
**This repo and its documentation is currently experimental and subject to change without notice.**

## Aims
* Support as many N64 FlashCarts as possible.
* Be open source using preferably MIT licensed third party licensed libraries where possible.
* Be testable, where possible using CTest, but if not, in an emulated environment.
* Encourage active development from community members and N64 FlashCart owners.
* Support [PixelFX N64Digital](https://gitlab.com/pixelfx-public/n64-game-id)


## Basic usage

### SC64
Download the `sc64menu.n64` ROM from the latest action run assets.
Add it to the root folder on your SD card.

Create a file called `config.sc64.toml.txt`
Add the following content, replacing the comments.
```
[last_rom]
    rom_path = "<!-- path to your ROM from the root of your SD card, note the quotes -->"
    save_path = "<!-- path to a save file from the root of your SD card, note the quotes -->"
    save_type = <!-- a number representing the save type (see save types) -->
    auto_load = <!-- a boolean value of `true` or `false` -->
    save_writeback = false

[last_state]
    auto_load_last_rom = false
    current_directory = "sd://"

[boot_params]
    device_type = 0;
    reset_type = 1;
    detect_tv_type = true;
    detect_cic_seed = true;
```
Save it to the root folder on your SD card.

#### Save types
`0` = NONE
`1` = EEPROM_4K
`2` = EEPROM_16K
`3` = SRAM
`4` = SRAM_BANKED
`5` = SRAM_128K
`6` = FLASHRAM
~~`15` = CART_HEADER~~


### ED64
Not currently not supported, but there is an aim to do so.
The aim is to replace [Altra64](https://github.com/networkfusion/altra64) and [ED64-UnofficialOS](https://github.com/n64-tools/ED64-UnofficialOS-binaries).


# Developer documentation
**Work in progress!**

You can use a dev container in VSCode to ease development.

Note: the dev container currently downloads and installs the latest available libdragon from the stable branch, rather than use the repos submodule.

To deploy:
* Download the deployer [here](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/download/v2.14.0/sc64-deployer-windows-v2.14.0.zip)
* Extract and place `sc64deployer.exe` in the `tools/sc64` directory
* For the moment, deployment cannot happen within the dev container and you must do it from a terminal on the host.
* Run `./deploy.bat` from the terminal (in windows)
* Toggle the N64 power switch to load the ROM.

`ms-vscode.makefile-tools` will help (installed automatically in dev container).
TODO: it does not yet work with `F5`: see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/now-announcing-makefile-support-in-visual-studio-code/
WORKAROUND: in the dev container terminal, use make directly, i.e.: `make`
The ROM can be found in the `output` directory.

NOTE: a "release" version of the SC64 menu is called `sc64menu.n64` and can be created for when you want to add it directly to the SDCard. This is generated by running `make all` or running `make sc64_minify`.

# Libdragon
This repo currently uses the `unstable` branch.
To update to the latest version, use `git submodule update --remote ` from the terminal.
